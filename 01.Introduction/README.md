- Create react app

## What is React

As per their [website](https://reactjs.org/) react is "A library for building user interfaces".

If we dig into that statment a little deeper we can say that React allows you to build complex user interfaces
from smaller isolated pieces of code called "components". These small pieces of code, components, are describing
what elements need to be rendered to the DOM. React also maintains any updates that need to be proccessed by state changes
but more about that later.

## Create React App

As per their [website](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) "an integrated toolchain".

Again if we dig a little deeper `create-react-app` basically just creates all the tooling boilerplate we need for a React app.
If we were doing it ourselves we would have to write all the configuration ourself. `create-react-app` abstracts this and gives us
a massive head start.

To set up a react app can run: `npx create-react-app my-app`

Then to start the application: `cd my-app` and then run `npm start`.
